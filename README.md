Deloitteâ€™s HR Dashboard:
We are developing on constructing a Tableau dashboard for Deloitte that will comprise of
numerous components, each of which will target a different area of Deloitte's HR
requirements and strategy. When put together, this dynamic and user-friendly dashboard will
give senior management at Deloitte useful insights that will support decision-making relating
to both strategy and human resources.


Element 1: Department-wise Attrition
<img width="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nv279/-Deloitte-s-HR-Dashboard/assets/128492452/e7242c44-6086-41d3-9201-dbe57ed0cdd2">

From this pie chart, The percentage of entry-level workers who want to leave their current
firm during the next five years is significantly higher than that of those at higher levels (42%
vs. 12%). Similar to entry-level legal workers, the majority of mid-level legal staff members
(36%) plan to stay with their current employers, with 24% citing career progression chances
as a key factor in their happiness on the job.
In order to successfully traverse the challenges of heading a legal function, today's legal
leaders, according to Bob Taylor, Managing Director of Legal Business Services at Deloitte Tax
LLP, must emphasise ongoing learning. This necessitates keeping abreast with developments
in the delivery of legal services, gaining an appreciation for how business needs are shifting,
and learning the ins and outs of new areas of law and risk. That's why many top lawyers are
looking elsewhere for work, where they can develop their expertise and put it to use in more
forward-thinking settings.



Element 2: Job Satisfaction
<img width="505" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nv279/-Deloitte-s-HR-Dashboard/assets/128492452/632a3f1d-d5bf-4a4b-83d7-f74988aac982">

From this bar graph, It is necessary to provide a workplace atmosphere that is
conducive to the development of relationships, as well as the satisfaction and productivity of
employees. It is common knowledge that each of the Big Four firms, including Deloitte, has a
culture that is distinctive from the others. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
relationship between the work environment at Deloitte and the level of satisfaction
experienced by employees there using a sample size of 125 people drawn from key cities in
India. In order to conduct the analysis of the association, statistical approaches were utilised.
The findings of the study make clear to managers the critical role that the setting of the
workplace plays in affecting the level of satisfaction experienced by employees.



Element 3: Employees by age.

From this histrogram, One of the world's most prestigious professional services firms,
Deloitte, recognises the significance of diversity and inclusion in its workforce. To cultivate
innovation, creativity, and improved problem-solving, the company values diversity across
many dimensions, including age. Although I do not have access to real-time data, as of my
most recent knowledge update in September 2021, Deloitte had an age-diverse workforce.
Deloitte is committed to fostering an environment where people of all ages can flourish and
contribute their unique perspectives. Deloitte hopes to benefit from the wealth of
experiences, knowledge, and skills that various generations bring to the table by having a
diverse age range among its employees.
The company recognises the value of intergenerational collaboration, in which
younger employees can contribute innovative ideas and technological know-how while more
seasoned professionals can provide mentorship and advice based on their years of industry
experience is essential to recognise that workforce demographics and specific diversity
initiatives can change over time. For the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding
employee diversity and age at Deloitte, I suggest consulting their website or contacting their
HR department.




Element 4: Work life in Deloitte
<img width="464" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nv279/-Deloitte-s-HR-Dashboard/assets/128492452/f9165f01-1ea7-489a-8aef-a4db8a470da8">

From this area chart, Deloitte acknowledges the significance of maintaining a healthy worklife balance for its employees and endeavours to cultivate a conducive atmosphere that
promotes such equilibrium. Despite the absence of real-time data, it is important to note that
as of the most recent knowledge update in September 2021, Deloitte has undertaken various
initiatives aimed at fostering a healthy work-life balance for its workforce.The organisation
recognises the significance of maintaining a harmonious equilibrium between work and
personal life, as it plays a pivotal role in promoting employee well-being, enhancing
productivity, and fostering job contentment. At Deloitte, employees are encouraged to
effectively manage their personal affairs in conjunction with their professional responsibilities.
Deloitte provides various flexible work arrangements, including remote work
opportunities, flexible scheduling, and part-time employment, with the aim of fostering a
harmonious equilibrium between professional and personal life. The company acknowledges
the existence of diverse individuals with distinct requirements and endeavours to fulfil those
needs to the utmost extent of its capabilities.



Element 5: Monthly Income
<img width="458" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nv279/-Deloitte-s-HR-Dashboard/assets/128492452/bd7243e8-751d-4f9c-8b3d-ee6f07c62766">

The amount of money brought in by employees each month at Deloitte is very variable and
can be affected by a variety of factors like job type, level of experience, geography, and others.
It is essential to keep in mind that particular compensation information is subject to change
over the course of time and might differ greatly depending on the many different individual
conditions. Deloitte is a multinational company that provides a wide variety of professional
services and jobs all over the world. These services and roles include consulting, auditing, tax,
and advisory positions. As a consequence of this, the amount of money an employee makes
can vary substantially depending on the job function they perform or their rank within the
organisation.
It is highly recommended that you consult Deloitte's official website or get in touch
with their HR department in order to receive information that is reliable and up-to-date
regarding monthly income or salary ranges at the company. They can provide more detailed
details depending on your qualifications as well as the career that you are specifically
interested in.
